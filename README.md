## Tasks

### Vowel discrimination
Used to study [perceptual constancy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07237-3), [vowel discrimination in noise](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833558v1) and [formant weighting](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4916690)

### Approach-to-target sound localization
Task for testing [effects of cortical inactivation on spatial hearing](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170264)

### Coordinate specific sound localization
Used to study whether listeners can report the location of sounds in [world or head-centered space](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2022/04/27/JNEUROSCI.0291-22.2022.abstract).

### Measuring frequency-response areas
Presentation of tones with varying intensities and frequencies, used to characterize the spectral tuning of neurons and map tonotopy across neural populations.
