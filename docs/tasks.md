# Go Ferret: Tasks

---

## Stimulus-Response Tasks

Tasks that involve training listeners to make specific responses to sounds. These tasks combine testing with early training levels.

### Vowel discrimination (@stephentown42)
Used to study [perceptual constancy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07237-3), [vowel discrimination in noise](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/833558v1) and [formant weighting](https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.4916690).

### Approach-to-target sound localization (@stephentown42, @kthcwd)
Task for testing [effects of cortical inactivation on spatial hearing](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170264).

### 5-choice auditory or visual localization (@slsdunn)
Variant of the approach to localization task for studying [hippocampal function](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.01.450507v2). 

### Coordinate specific sound localization (@stephentown42)
Used to study whether listeners can report the location of sounds in [world or head-centered space](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2022/04/27/JNEUROSCI.0291-22.2022.abstract).

## Passive Tasks

Tasks that do not require specific responses from listeners. These tasks usually do not have training levels.

### Presenting audiovisual streams
Studying the role of temporal coherence in [audiovisual binding](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)31182-0).

### Measuring spatial receptive fields with head-tracking
Used to dissociate [coordinate frames in which neurons are sensitive to sound location](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001878).

### Measuring frequency-response areas
Presentation of tones with varying intensities and frequencies, used to characterize the spectral tuning of neurons and map tonotopy across neural populations.
